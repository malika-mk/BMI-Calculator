Project Description

The BMI Calculator is a JavaFX application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) using two different unit systems: Metric (kilograms and centimeters) and English (pounds and inches). Users can input their weight and height, and the application computes their BMI along with the corresponding weight category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese). The application features a simple user interface with menus for help, clearing input fields, and exiting the application.
